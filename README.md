# About
This operating system is based on [Philipp Oppermann's blog-os](https://github.com/phil-opp/blog_os). It's written specifically for the raspberry pi
# How to install
This os is still under development (although not very frequent). However, you can build the boot image yourself by downloading the main branch and run it in [qemu](https://www.qemu.org/). You can find stable releases in `.bin` and `.iso` file types in the [releases tab](https://github.com/darkstormdev/os/releases)
# Branch info
This branch is for developing updates before they are merged into the main branch.
# Features
No new features for now. Reading and writing GPIO pins is the next planned feature
# Updates
`-No updates for now, just the same code as blog-os`
